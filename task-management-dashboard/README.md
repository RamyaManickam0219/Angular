# TaskManagementDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.3.

## Installation

Install Angular CLI globally using command `npm i -g @angular/cli`.
Install NPM in both backend-server application and the task-management-dashboard application using `npm install`.

## Development backend

Run `node server.js` to run the backend node.js server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. We need to re-run the backend server if you change any of the source files. In this backend-server I have added default user and task details.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
