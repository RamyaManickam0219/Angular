## Installation

Install NPM in both backend-server application using `npm install`.

## Development backend

Run `node server.js` to run the backend node.js server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. We need to re-run the backend server if you change any of the source files. In this backend-server I have added default user and task details.
